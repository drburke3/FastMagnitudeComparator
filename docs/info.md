## How it works

For neuron thereshold determination in digital approaches,
a fast magnitude determination is often necessary.  

This component is based upon well-documented Clint Cole (Digilent) bit-sliced expandable, 
structural code re-expressed in AND-INV format to target optimized
ABC9 AIG graph synthesis in OpenLane. 
https://www.realdigital.org/doc/a39d855f71772426c968c0151112b476

It is intentionally unclocked for measurements, and can be easily modified as a windowing-comparator 
for inference field requirements.

The fast magnitude comparitor is second of a series of common, scaleable library of elements
intended to support CMOS digital neuron biomemetic building blocks, the first being a
scaleable fast accumulator for vector evaluation and integration based upon a generated
Sklansky adder/subtractor.

Each component is intended to be fashioned in structural Verilog for future optimization, scale well
so as to support varying bit-width large vector resolutions, and whenever possible described in
AND-INV form to leverage the OpenLane ABC9 logic optimizer which uses AIG graphs.

## How to test

The user will supply two numbers of appropriate length (A, B, 8 bits in this case) and receive back signals
indicating "A less than B", "A equal to B", or "A greater than B" as LT_out, EQ_out, and GT_out respectively.

## External hardware

Means to supply appropiate with words (in this instance one 8b byte) and read back GT, EQ, LT signals.
